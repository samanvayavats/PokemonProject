In this project, I have used the Pokémon API to display various attributes of Pokémon, such as speed, abilities, height, weight, experience, and attack. The project also includes a search functionality for easy filtering of Pokémon. Additionally, I have implemented routing concepts to navigate between pages, and there is a contact form in the "Contact Us" section where you can reach out to me. </h2>
